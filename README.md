### Overview 

With the evolution of science and the growing computational possibilities, differentiation plays a critical role in a wide range of scientific and industrial applications of computer science. However, the precise computation of symbolic derivatives is computationally expensive, and not even possible in all situations, whereas the finite differencing method is not always accurate or stable. Automatic differentiation, however, provides a computationally efficient way to calculate derivatives, particularly of complex functions, for applications where accuracy and performance at scale are important.

Our package **AutoDiffCC** provides is an easy to use package that computes derivates of scalar and vector functions using the concept of automatic differentation. 

We invite you to take a look at our repo and use **AutoDiffCC**!
