## Introduction

## Background

Our software will make it easier for the user to compute derivatives using automatic differentiation. Our software will be able to compute the values of a function as well as its derivatives at specified points. Autodifferentiation provides efficiency and numerical stability as opposed to other methods such as finate differences. To work, the functions make use of the following concepts:

### The Chain Rule

According to the chain rule the derivative of f(g(x)) is f'(g(x))â‹…g'(x).

See the following example: 


### Computational Grapth
### Elementry Functions
