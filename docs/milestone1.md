## Introduction
With the evolution of science from empirical to theoretical and now computational approaches, differentiation plays a critical role in a wide range of scientific and industrial applications of computer science. However, the precise computation of symbolic derivatives is computationally expensive, and not even possible in all situations, whereas the finite differencing method is not always accurate or stable. Automatic Differentiation, however, provides a computationally efficient way to calculate derivatives, particularly of complex functions, for applications where accuracy and performance at scale are important.
